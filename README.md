# error : 

 bundling failed: Error: While trying to resolve module `react-native-otp-inputs` from file `F:\SampleProject\App.js`, the package `F:\SampleProject\node_modules\react-native-otp-inputs\package.json` was successfully found. However, this package itself specifies a `main` module field that could not be resolved (`F:\SampleProject\node_modules\react-native-otp-inputs\lib\index.tsx`. Indeed, none of these files exist:

  * `F:\SampleProject\node_modules\react-native-otp-inputs\lib\index.tsx(.native||.android.js|.native.js|.js|.android.json|.native.json|.json)`
  * `F:\SampleProject\node_modules\react-native-otp-inputs\lib\index.tsx\index(.native||.android.js|.native.js|.js|.android.json|.native.json|.json)`
